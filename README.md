## About me
I am originally a self-taught developer. In 2014 I taught myself enough HTML/CSS to start workig as a freelancer web developer.

I love working in a team, with (or not) pair-programming, sharing experiences, helping each other to accomplish the hardest challenges and grow up together as a professional and in other fields of knowledge. I like face-to-face communication, but I'm also good at chatting (slack, hangouts, e-mail, ...). I learn by doing, teaching and reading. I use to work in my own side projects, participate in development events, meetups, talks and everything related to software development to acquire the best knowledge possible.
